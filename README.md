The **UNIT BMM350 Magnetometer I3C Module** is a compact and efficient magnetometer designed for magnetic field sensing. It utilizes the BMM350 sensor from Bosch, which supports I3C communication for fast data transfer and low power consumption. I3C is a modern communication protocol that allows multiple devices to be connected on the same bus, making it ideal for applications requiring multiple sensors.
